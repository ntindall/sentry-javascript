## 4.0.0

This is the release of our new SDKs, `@sentry/browser`, `@sentry/node`. While there are too many changes to list for
this release, we will keep a consistent changelog for upcoming new releases. `raven-js` (our legacy JavaScript/Browser
SDK) and `raven` (our legacy Node.js SDK) will still reside in this repo, but they will receive their own changelog.

We generally guide people to use our new SDKs from this point onward. The migration should be straightforward if you
were only using the basic features of our previous SDKs.

`raven-js` and `raven` will both still receive bugfixes but all the new features implemented will only work in the new
SDKs. The new SDKs are completely written in TypeScript, which means all functions, classes and properties are typed.

### Migration

Here are some examples of how the new SDKs work. Please note that the API for all JavaScript SDKs is the same.

#### Installation

_Old_:

```js
Raven.config('___PUBLIC_DSN___', {
  release: '1.3.0',
}).install();
```

_New_:

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  release: '1.3.0',
});
```

#### Set a global tag

_Old_:

```js
Raven.setTagsContext({ key: 'value' });
```

_New_:

```js
Sentry.configureScope(scope => {
  scope.setTag('key', 'value');
});
```

#### Capture custom exception

_Old_:

```js
try {
  throwingFunction();
} catch (e) {
  Raven.captureException(e, { extra: { debug: false } });
}
```

_New_:

```js
try {
  throwingFunction();
} catch (e) {
  Sentry.withScope(scope => {
    scope.setExtra('debug', false);
    Sentry.captureException(e);
  });
}
```

#### Capture a message

_Old_:

```js
Raven.captureMessage('test', 'info', { extra: { debug: false } });
```

_New_:

```js
Sentry.withScope(scope => {
  scope.setExtra('debug', false);
  Sentry.captureMessage('test', 'info');
});
```

#### Breadcrumbs

_Old_:

```js
Raven.captureBreadcrumb({
  message: 'Item added to shopping cart',
  category: 'action',
  data: {
    isbn: '978-1617290541',
    cartSize: '3',
  },
});
```

_New_:

```js
Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
  message: 'Item added to shopping cart',
  category: 'action',
  data: {
    isbn: '978-1617290541',
